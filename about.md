My name is Paul Nesbitt, and I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I moved to Houston when I was 2, so I've lived here for
about 22 years now, with 4 of those being spent in Austin for college. I graduated in 2013 from the University of Texas
at Austin with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. After moving back to Houston, I originally worked as
a C/C++ software developer for a cloud storage company called MediaFire, and am now doing Qt/C/C++ development for a
small consulting company called Erdos Miller.

A few more things about me:
I've got an older brother.
I went skydiving for my 24th birthday.
I enjoy cooking.
I'm a clean freak.
I like to play disc golf.
