![Test image](/images/about_profile.jpg) My name is Paul Nesbitt, and I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I moved to Houston when I was 2, so I've lived here for about 22 years now, with 4 of those being spent in Austin for college. I graduated in 2013 from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. After moving back to Houston, I originally worked as a C/C++ software developer for a cloud storage company called MediaFire, and am now doing Qt/C/C++ development for a small consulting company called Erdos Miller.
