So I finally got Jekyll working on Windows and am now starting to update my blog. Found out later that GitHub was having none of it, and gave me build errors with no indication as to what the error actually was when I tried to push it. Fun... Figured out it was the highlighter rouge gem that the Jekyll for Windows guide suggested to use instead of pygments (didn't want to install all of the extra stuff to try and make pygments work). So doing what Alex suggested previously in an email and just set highlighter to none. Everyone is happy. Moving on!

Things seem to be working how I'd expect now. Getting to mess around with site design, which I'm not quite used to yet I suppose. So currently, not too happy with my design choices, but hey, that's part of the process. Should probably use less dark colours, but let's say it's Halloween colours for now.
