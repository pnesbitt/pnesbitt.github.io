Like I mentioned in my previous blog post, try to catch up on these a bit. So writing 3 quick posts to go over the passed few weeks.

So last week we learned about Zurb's Foundation package, and it's awesome! Makes it so much easier to layout a website! Just include a few classes on your containers and what not, and you've got a great base to start from! You can even make it responsive very easily too! So pretty psyched about learning this, and will definitely be making use of it.
