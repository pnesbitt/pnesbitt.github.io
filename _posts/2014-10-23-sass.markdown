So to go along with learning Foundation, we also learned about Sass, CSS with Superpowers. I can definitely see the benefits of it, but at the time, was more interested in Foundation. So this is definitely something I need to look through a bit more thoroughly because it could help a lot I'm sure. Wish there was more time in the day to do so...
