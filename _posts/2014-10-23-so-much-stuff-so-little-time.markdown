So work has been very hectic lately and I realized I never even got a second legit blog post written when we started learning Jekyll, so here it is. Time to try and catch up a bit.

Like I said, work has been really busy. Boss has been pushing everyone to try to work overtime since there is so much to do. Granted, the included benefits with that are nice (overtime pay, free dinner, etc etc), but that leaves very little time to myself with this class included as well. So I've started getting behind in my classwork, and don't really have much time or incentive to try and do homework when I get home just from working so much. So sorry about that, and here's the first step. Time to go write more blog posts.
